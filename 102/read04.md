javascript has two types of expressions expression that hust assign a value to a variable for example var color = 'beige'; 
expression that use two or more values to return a single value for example var area = 3 * 2;
and like all programming language javascript has mathmatical operators + - / * 
also it uses string operators For example, you might have a first and last name in two separate
variables and want to join them to show a full name. In this example, the
variable called full Name would hold the string 'Ivy Stone'.
var firstName = 'Ivy ' ;
var lastName = ' Stone' ;
var ful l Name = f irstName + l astName ;
