1_ first thing add a current node that points <br>
 at the current node and assign it to the head.<br>

2_ create a new node for the value<br>

3_ Then by using while loop and current.next loop through the linked list<br>

4_ create a condition to check if the current node is equal to the value. <br>

5_  add a reference for the new node to the current node.next. <br>
