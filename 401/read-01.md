What I have learned about:
### Variables
Instance Variables (Non-Static Fields): their values are unique to each instance of a class<br>
Class Variables (Static Fields): their values will never change.<br>
Local Variables<br>
Parameters<br>
Variable names are case-sensitive<br>
begin your variable names with a letter<br>
dollar sign character, by convention, is never used<br>
use full words instead of cryptic abbreviations<br>
If it consists of more than one word, capitalize the first letter of each subsequent word<br>
If your variable stores a constant value capitalize every letter and separating subsequent words with the <br>underscore character
### Operators
postfix expr++ expr-- <br>
unary ++expr --expr +expr -expr ~ !<br>
additive + -<br>
multiplicative * / %<br>
shift << >> >>><br>
relational < > <= >= instanceof<br>
equality == !=<br>
bitwise AND &<br>
logical OR ||<br>
bitwise exclusive OR ^<br>
logical AND &&<br>
bitwise inclusive OR |<br>
ternary ? :<br>
assignment = += -= *= /= %= &= ^= |= <<= >>= >>>=<br>
Expressions, Statements, and Blocks<br>
An expression is a construct made up of variables, operators, and method invocations
Statements are roughly equivalent to sentences in natural languages. A statement forms a complete unit of execution
expression statements<br>
declaration statements<br>
control flow statements<br>
A block is a group of zero or more statements between balanced braces and can be used anywhere a single statement is allowed.<br>
Control Flow Statements<br>
Control flow statements, break up the flow of execution by employing decision making, looping, and branching, enabling your program to conditionally execute particular blocks of code.<br>

### Reddit thread on compiling<br>
the compiler (usually another program) takes the program the human wrote, and converts it into the program the computer can understand

### Reading Java Documentation <br>
how to find something, by using the index.
