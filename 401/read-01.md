What I have learned about:
### Variables
Instance Variables (Non-Static Fields): their values are unique to each instance of a class
Class Variables (Static Fields): their values will never change.
Local Variables
Parameters
Variable names are case-sensitive
begin your variable names with a letter
dollar sign character, by convention, is never used
use full words instead of cryptic abbreviations
If it consists of more than one word, capitalize the first letter of each subsequent word
If your variable stores a constant value capitalize every letter and separating subsequent words with the underscore character
### Operators
postfix expr++ expr--
unary ++expr --expr +expr -expr ~ !
additive + -
multiplicative * / %
shift << >> >>>
relational < > <= >= instanceof
equality == !=
bitwise AND &
logical OR ||
bitwise exclusive OR ^
logical AND &&
bitwise inclusive OR |
ternary ? :
assignment = += -= *= /= %= &= ^= |= <<= >>= >>>=
Expressions, Statements, and Blocks
An expression is a construct made up of variables, operators, and method invocations
Statements are roughly equivalent to sentences in natural languages. A statement forms a complete unit of execution
expression statements
declaration statements
control flow statements
A block is a group of zero or more statements between balanced braces and can be used anywhere a single statement is allowed.
Control Flow Statements
Control flow statements, break up the flow of execution by employing decision making, looping, and branching, enabling your program to conditionally execute particular blocks of code.

### Reddit thread on compiling
the compiler (usually another program) takes the program the human wrote, and converts it into the program the computer can understand
