by comparion operators you can  compare and evaluate the situation , and the result will be in boolean .
we have many camparison operators : (is equal to == and != ) it just compares the values , 
( strict equal to === and strict not equal to !===) it compares the values and the data types , greater than > and less than < 
greater than or equal >= and less than or equal to <= ,examples : '3' == 3 is true , but '3' === 3 is false because the data type 
is not the same .

logical operatores allow you comare the results of more one comarison operator , we have three logical operators 
1- (logical and  && this operator tests more than one condition )  both statement should be true in order the result is true .
2 - lodical or :this operator tests more than one condition as well, at least one statement should be true in order the result is true .
3- logical not ! it reverses the result . if the result true it will convert it to false .

you can excute the loops by (for , while , do while ) 
1 -for loop has three parts ( initialization , condition , update ) it makes loops with limited count .
2- while loop has a condition and it loops until the conndition is false .
3- do while loop , same of while loops but the difference it loops the first time whatever the condition is false or true .
