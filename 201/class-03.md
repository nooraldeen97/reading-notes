lists in **CSS** divided into three groups :
-unordered lisits : the tag is ol , and each items on it with li tag . 
-ordered lists :the tag is ul , and each items on it with li tag .  
-definition lists :the main tag is dl , include two tags dt wich is the difintion term and dd which is the difintion itself .

**Boxes in CSS :** By default a box is sized just big enough to hold its contents and you can manage its size by write for exaample
div.box , and put the height , width and the background color you want .

**minmum width and maximum width :** the min-width property specifies the smallest size a box can be displayed at when the browser
window is narrow, and the max-width property indicates the maximum width a box can stretch to when the browser window is wide.

same thing for man height and max height , but if the content larger than the box you have two options hidden or scroll .

**border:**The border separates the edge of one box from another. 
**margin:**You can set the width of a margin to create a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes.
**padding:**Adding padding can increase the readability of its contents.

**Arrays in js :** An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values.
You create an array and give it a name just like you would any other variable (using the var keyword followed by the name ofthe array).

**switch statement :** A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value and you have the cases and break to get out side 
the statement when the case is true .
