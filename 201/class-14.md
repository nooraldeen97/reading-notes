**Organising and Planning Skills**
Being organised is essential to getting tasks done.<br>

If you don’t know what needs to be done, and by when, it’s quite hard to make it happen by your deadline.  Shapers, <br>
Implementers and Completer-Finishers are all characterised by good organising skills, and can usually be relied upon <br>
to put in place strong systems for managing projects well.<br>

**Problem-Solving**
Task-focused people are often adept at problem-solving, especially if the problem relates to the task.<br>

Plants look for innovative ideas to solve the problem, and Implementers will turn ideas into practical action.<br>

Shapers will see the ‘big picture’ and the overall plan, making sure that the solution to the problem does not result in a change of direction<br>

**Feedback Skills**
Giving and receiving feedback well is essential in any team-working situation. Being able to give clear and effective feedback to others is vital <br>
to keep the group process running effectively, and to plan. It also helps to ensure that you do not get irritated and angry with the way that <br>others 
are behaving. It follows that you also need to be able to receive feedback gracefully, and then act on it calmly.
