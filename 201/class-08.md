**layout:** its the flow of the content around your web page , Css can move your content wherever you want and you 
can divide the content into blocks (boxes) by make a padding , margin , border and background-color .<br>

Css treats each elements as it is in its own box ,this box could be an inline box or block box ,If one block-level 
element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.<br>

**position:static** In normal flow, each block-level element sits on top of the next one.<br>

**position:relative** Relative positioning moves an element in relation to where it would have been in normal flow.<br>

**position:absolute** When the position property is given a value of absolute,the box is taken out of normal
flow and no longer affects the position of other elements on the page.<br>

**position:fixed** Fixed positioning is a type of absolute positioning that requires the position property
to have a value of fixed.<br>

**Floating Elements** The float property allows you to take an element in normal flow and place it as far to the
left or right of the containing element as possible.<br>

**screen size:** visitors for your website my have different screen sizes , so it should be considered when you are
styling your pages ,so Because screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much, webdesigners often try to create 
pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide (since most users will be able to see designs this wide on their screens).<br>

**Fixed Width Layouts** Fixed width layout designs do not change size as the user increases or decreases
the size of their browser window , Measurements tend to be given in pixels.<br>

**Liquid Layouts** Liquid layout designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the
size of their browser window. They tend to use percentages.<br>

Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
