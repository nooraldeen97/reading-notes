What is a component?<br>
**Answer:**A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that<br> encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.

What are the charactistics of a component?<br>
**Answer:**
Reusability − Components are usually designed to be reused in different situations in different applications.<br> However, some components may be designed for a specific task.

Replaceable − Components may be freely substituted with other similar components.<br>

Not context specific − Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.<br>

Extensible − A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.<br>

Encapsulated − A A component depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do <br>not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.

Independent − Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.<br>

What are the advantages of using component based architecture?<br>
**Answer:**
Ease of deployment − As new compatible versions become available, it is easier to replace existing versions <br>with no impact on the other components or the system as a whole.

Reduced cost − The use of third-party components allows you to spread the cost of development and maintenance.<br>

Ease of development − Components implement well-known interfaces to provide defined functionality, allowing <br><br>development without impacting other parts of the system.

Reusable − The use of reusable components means that they can be used to spread the development and maintenance<br> cost across several applications or systems.

Modification of technical complexity − A component modifies the complexity through the use of a component<br> container and its services.

Reliability − The overall system reliability increases since the reliability of each individual component <br>enhances the reliability of the whole system via reuse.

System maintenance and evolution − Easy to change and update the implementation without affecting the rest of the system.

Independent − Independency and flexible connectivity of components. Independent development of components by<br> different group in parallel. Productivity for the software development and future software development.



What is props short for?<br>
**Answer:**
“Props” is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one <br>component to another.

How are props used in React?<br>
**Answer:**
Firstly, define an attribute and its value(data)<br>
Then pass it to child component(s) by using Props<br>
Finally, render the Props Data

What is the flow of props?<br>
**Answer:**
But the important part here is that data with props are being passed in a uni-directional flow. <br>(one way from parent to child)<br>
